### Serial README ###
This serial project makes it easy to handle serial devices in C in Linux. Using Termios structures tend to be awkward, repetitive, and overly verbose.  This project simplifies serial programming by setting widely used defaults (raw input/no parity checking) and
one only needs to pass a file descriptor to perform serial transactions

##Testing##
This project uses the check unit testing library for testing. 
   if Ubuntu,
      sudo apt-get install check
      
   This project has only been tested in Linux
